[CCS](https://neogames4.github.io/ccs.html) ("Cool Collection System") is a system for data serialization and data interchange.

```python
<
  name: "CCS", "Cool Collection System";

  latest: 1, 0, 0, "https://github.com/NeoGames4/CCS/releases";

It was designed for a coding competition, so it is nothing big and serious, but it has some pretty handy features.
